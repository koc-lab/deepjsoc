To reproduce the results, follow these steps:

1- run `train_estimator.py` to generate the estimator file. We advise you to set `Nc` and `channel_bits`.

2- run `main.py` to train the end-to-end model. We advise to specify the relevant parameters and specify the estimator file.

3- run `performance.py` for performance evaluation.
